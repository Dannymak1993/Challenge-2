# <Danny's Initial Portfolio Mockup>

## Description

This project focuses on creating a website from scratch utilizing everything learned in module 1: html, css and git as well as module 2: advanced css. This includes big concepts such as flexbox and media query. My initial mockup portfolio will serve as a work in progress until the end of bootcamp at which point it will be completely overhauled to include many of the programming languages we learned throughout the 3 months. This portfolio, although in it's early stages, will be an initial draft at what employers in the future may possibly see when deciding whether or not to offer me an interview for a job. Working on this portfolio has helped me experiment with and improve my ability to work with not only just flexbow and media query, but the fundamentals of HTML, git and CSS that will improve all my future projects.

## Credits

Multiple google sources were used for educational purposes in the topics of CSS animation transitions and flexbox usage.
The reset.css stylesheet was copied from bootcamp materials given to me although any general reset document found off google would suffice.
